Traditional CCTV surveillance relies heavily on manual monitoring, which is not only labour-intensive but also susceptible to human errorâ€”especially when interpreting complex and unpredictable human behaviour. To overcome these limitations, this project proposes a suspicious activity detection system utilizing deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is developed using Python and integrated into a web-based interface through the Django framework, enabling scalable deployment and user-friendly monitoring. It processes the recorded video feeds to classify behaviour as suspicious and automatically alerts the concerned authorities when suspicious activity is detected. By leveraging advanced CNN model, the system significantly enhances detection accuracy, reduces false positives, and improves the overall reliability of surveillance operations and has Accuracy of 91 to 96% . This approach minimizes dependence on manual intervention and ensures faster, data-driven responses to potential threats in a smarter and more efficient security management system
